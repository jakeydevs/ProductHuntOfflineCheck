# ProductHuntBot

Way of looking back to a date (since November 2013) to get a list of hunts - and then check if they are online still or not!

A very cool way of seeing what was popular in the past, but didn't survive!

## Installation

> $ cp .env.example .env
> $ composer install && npm install
> \$ npm run prod (dev)

You need an application code from product hunt to run this - you can get that from https://api.producthunt.com/v2/oauth/applications

Put the developer token in a ENV variable called: PRODUCT_HUNT_AUTH
